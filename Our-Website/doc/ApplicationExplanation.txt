
BACKGROUND:
I am Sunari Mulyawan Wegner, an Indonesia citizen and I came to the USA in 2013 on a Fiance Visa. I married my husband, Kurt Wegner, a US born citizen. We live at our home in the mountains of Colorado. I fulfilled all requirements of the Fiance Visa and became a Permanent Resident of the US. My children, Rayna and Levi, live in Makassar with their father. The father has full-time custody of the 2 children under the written divorce agreement. My desire is that Rayna and Levi be allowed to visit me sometimes in America and then return to their home in Indonesia.

WHY RAYNA AND LEVI WERE DENIED A VISITOR VISA AT THE US CONSULATE IN SURABAYA:
1) The interviewer said "You cannot get a visa, your children applied for an immigrant visa"
2) The interviewer said that because I live in America "They are tied to America" 

1) WHAT THE INTERVIEWER SAID ABOUT APPLYING FOR AN IMMIGRANT VISA IS NOT TRUE:
The interviewer looked at my immigration history in her computer and said that Kurt, my husband, applied for an immigrant visa for my children and it was "pending". Therefore, my children cannot get a US Visitor Visa. This is not true! Kurt has never applied for an immigrant visa for my children. Kurt applied for the Fiance Visa for me in 2013 (six years ago) but not for my children to come with me (see Form I-864 in my immigration history). Since I am a US permanent resident, my children are eligible to apply for an immigrant visa. Immediately after this disappointing interview we contacted the US Consulate in Surabaya by email and here is what the Nonimmigrant Visa Unit told us, as we expected: "Being eligible for an immigrant visa by having a qualified relative who could petition for a person does not mean that they are ineligible for a nonimmigrant visa". The interviewer was wrong in saying that Kurt applied for immigrant visas and the interviewer was again wrong in saying that because I am a qualified relative to petition for immigration for my children then they are ineligible for a nonimmigrant visa.

2) WHAT THE INTERVIEWER SAID ABOUT MY CHILDREN TIED TO AMERICA IS NOT TRUE:
The interviewer had no basis for saying this because she would not let me speak or present the evidence. The main purpose of the interview is to present the evidence that my children will return to Indonesia after visiting me in America. However, The interviewer terminated the interview abruptly and would not allow me to explain or show the evidence that my children are completely tied to their home in Indonesia and not to America.
