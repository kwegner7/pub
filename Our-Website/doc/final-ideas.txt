Section 6.01 Woodland Park House
It should say "if both Rayna and Levi and all of their
               descendants are deceased ..."

Section 6.02 Hyannis House
This is the Wegner family house, we would like this to be:
    Davida --> her descendants Ruby and Lily
           --> pro rata Heather and Shawnine or their descendants
           --> Article 10 

Section 10.02 Davida
We would like this to be:
    Davida --> pro rata Ruby, Lily, Heather, Shawnine or their descendants
           --> Article 11

Section 10.03 Rayna
Should be the same as Section 6.01, that is:
    Rayna --> her descendants --> Levi --> his descendants --> Article 11

Section 10.04 Levi
Same idea as Rayna
