SUMMARY:

This program determines all prime numbers less than 10,000. It does this by
spawning 25 threads running in a Linux process environment. There are 25 primes
less than 100. For each prime less than 100, there is a distinct thread. Each
thread determines which numbers from 2 to 10,000 are multiples of this prime.
For example, the thread for prime 5 will determine that 5, 10, 15, 20 ...
are multiples of 5 and thus these numbers are not prime numbers.

There is a shared resource for collecting the set of all non-prime numbers.
The 25 threads are competing to update this shared resource. This shared
resource is a C++ Standard Template Library "set" container. This is a race
condition. The C++ <thread> library is used to protect the shared resource
by means of its mutex capability.
