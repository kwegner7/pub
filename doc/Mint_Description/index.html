You can do this from any country because it is on the Web. You can see if the
Joint Beyond Banking is becoming too low. You can see if the Bank of America Checking Account
has enough money for you to withdraw from an ATM using the Bank of America Debit Card.<br><br>
Sign in to <b>www.mint.com</b> with the email and password shown below.<br><br>
Sometimes they will send a 6 digit code to your email account. If so, open the email, then enter the 6 digit code.
Sometimes they might ask you for your phone number. This is optional so click "Skip for now". Do not give them your phone number 
because when you are in Indonesia you will not have a phone connection. 
You want them to always send the 6 digit code to your email.

<dl>
  <dt>401K Roth Peraton</dt>
  <dd>
  This is the 401K that I earned while employed by Peraton. A percentage of this amount
  was contributed by Peraton. A 401K is eventually converted to an IRA after the employment
  ceases. This is a Roth account so the interest earned is not taxed.
  </dd>

  <dt>401K Roth Caliola</dt>
  <dd>
  This is the 401K that I am currently earning while employed by Caliola. A percentage of this amount
  was contributed by Caliola. This is a Roth account so the interest earned is not taxed.
  </dd>

  <dt>IRA Kurt</dt>
  <dd>
  This is the Individual Retirement Account that I have accumulated over many years by added money
  from each paycheck.
  </dd>

  <dt>IRA Roth Kurt</dt>
  <dd>
  I converted some of the IRA Kurt to be a Roth IRA by paying taxes on the money. A Roth IRA is better 
  because you never have to pay taxes in the future for any interest earned.
  </dd>

  <dt>Joint Beyond Banking</dt>
  <dd>
  All of our income goes here - my paycheck, my social security, my ITT pension. We pay all of our bills
  from here. We wire money to Indonesia from here.
