<h4 class="teal">Nary's Income After Kurt Dies</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  After Kurt dies, Nary's income will come from:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size: 90%">
    <li>Social Security payments based on lifetime work earnings of Kurt</li>
    <li>Social Security payments based on lifetime work earnings of Nary</li>
    <li>Withdrawal of funds from Nary's Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
        inherited from Kurt</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  There are 2 kinds of Social Security benefits:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size: 90%">
    <li>Spousal Benefits - while Kurt is alive</li>
    <li>Survivor Benefits - subsequent to Kurt's death</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Social Security <u>Spousal</u> Benefit - While Kurt is Alive </h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  Kurt's monthly gross Social Security benefit is $4,029.<br>
  If Kurt is alive when Nary reaches age 67 then Nary will receive her Spousal Benefit.
  This benefit is 50% of Kurt's monthly benefit or $2,015.
  Nary may take this Spousal Benefit as early as age 62, but the amount will be reduced forever.
  <br><br>
  <em>So Nary's Social Security Spousal Benefit will be $24,180 per year until Kurt dies.</em>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Social Security <u>Survivor</u> Benefit - After Kurt Has Died</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  Kurt's monthly gross Social Security benefit is $4,029.<br>
  If Kurt dies after Nary reaches age 67 then Nary will receive her <em>Survivor</em> Benefit.
  This benefit is 100% of Kurt's monthly benefit or $4,029.
  Nary may take this <em>Survivor</em> Benefit as early as age 60, but the amount will be reduced forever.
  <br><br>
  <em>So Nary's Social Security Survivor Benefit will be $48,348 per year subsequent to Kurt's death.</em>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Individual Retirement Account (IRA)</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  Since 1975, I have been contributing to an IRA. My intention is to provide income
  to my wife and daughter after my death. So I have never removed funds from the IRA
  except for downpayment on our house. I have never taken money out of the IRA
  for myself because this money belongs to my wife and my daughter, not to me.
  Because I have not removed money from the IRA, it has accumulated by investment
  and compounded interest over many years. The IRA belongs 80% to my wife and %20
  to my daughter.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Estimate of IRA Income for Nary After My Death</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  Total of all Traditional and Roth IRA accounts is $1,777,000 on Nov 14, 2022.<br>
  80% of this is $1,421,600<br>
  So annual income from IRA withdrawals over 20 years is $71,080<br>
  Monthly income from IRA withdrawals over 20 years is $5,923<br>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Total Monthly and Annual Income for Nary After My Death</h4>
<br>
<div>
  <pre>
                    Monthly Income  Annual Income
   Social Security     $4,029          $48,348
   IRA Withdrawals     $5,923          $71,080  
            TOTALS     $9,952         $119,428
  </pre>
  <p class="shift" style="font-size: 90%">
  You will have to pay taxes on this income. The tax rate will be less than
  it is now because the total income is less.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h4 class="teal">Consequence of Taking Money Out of the IRA</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p>
  Suppose the goal is to get $100,000 from the IRA to use for some purpose.<br>
  But it is necessary to take more out of the IRA to pay the tax on the withdrawal.
  The current tax bracket for us is 24% in 2022.<br><br>
  Let X be the amount that has to be withdrawn in order to net $100,000.<br>
  Then X - (.24X) = 100,000<br>
  X = 131,579<br><br>
  So to pay taxes on the $100,000 it is necessary to take $131,579 out of the IRA.<br><br>
  Because the IRA has $131,579 less money, over 10 years the IRA will have
  lost a total of $45,252 in compound interest assuming an interest rate of 3% each year.
  So the total money lost to the IRA is $131,579 + $45,252 = $176,831
  in order to get $100,000
  </p>

<h4 class="teal">Budget</h4>
<br>
<div class="shift">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Goals For Our Budget:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size: 90%">
    <li>Do not take any money from Nary's IRA until I die.</li>
    <li>Keep a balance in Joint Beyond Banking of $20,000 as I always have in the
        past. This is a measure of how well we are keeping to the budget. If there
        is more than $20,000 then we are doing fine and this extra money can be spent.
        If there is less than $20,000 then we must reduce expenses until there is
        again $20,000.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I am providing $14,000 per month for us to live on. I have no savings account.
     I gave my savings to you and Davida long ago. Because I do not have a savings account, 
     I must buy things for myself from the income I earn from Social Security, pension from ITT and job with Caliola.</p>

  <p>Our monthly expenses seem to be about $9000 per month. This includes a couple of
     vacation trips per year. So we are making about $5,000 per month or $60,000 per year
     over our expenses. This is discretionary money and can be spent as we choose.
  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Suggestion for spending each month:</p>

  <p style="font-size: 90%">
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size: 90%">
    <li>Give $1,000 to Nary so that she can increase her savings.</li>
    <li>Give $833 to Rayna and Levi so that they have $10,000 per year until 
        they no longer need it.</li>
    <li>Give some of this monthly income to Nary until my debt is paid.
        This can be adjusted more or less to change the duration of the debt repayment.</li>
    <li>Increase our payment of the mortgage so that we can payoff the house in 5 years. This
        will reduce our monthly expenses by $2,500.
    </li>
    <li>Buy the things we want as long as there is about about $20,000 in Joint Beyond Banking.
        For example: new bathroom shower, new kitchen island, vacation to other countries,
        vacation to America, new car.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 90%">
  I am currently adding to Nary's IRA through contributions to a Roth 401K at Caliola.
  This amounts to about $1,154 per month or $13,846 per year.<br><br>
  I suggest that this budget begin after we return from Indonesia.
