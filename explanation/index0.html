  This is a link to the website for the Faraja Orphans Rescue Ministry in Musoma, Tanzania:

  <p>
  The website of the Faraja Orphans Rescue Ministry allows making donations using PayPal.
  I helped Samuel to set this up and I volunteered to process the donations each month. 
  The donations are sent to our Joint Beyond Banking account. Then I send them by
  check through the mail to Hart Inlow who is part of the Lion of Judah Ministries. 
  He then wires the donations to Samuel Mpenalehi in Tanzania. This is a diagram of
  the entire Paypal process showing how a donation is sent through our Joint Beyond Banking
  to the ministry in Tanzania:

  <p>
  The following link shows all donations over the last 3 years from private donors in America and
  Germany. So I have sent many checks to Lion of Judah in Florida. But it is not our
  money, it is donated money we received into our Joint Beyond Banking account:
