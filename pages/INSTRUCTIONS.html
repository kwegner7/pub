<h4 class="blue under">Object Oriented Programming</h4>
<p>
One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming
techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable
programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new
type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that
inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes
object-oriented programs easier to modify.

<h4 class="blue under">Encapsulation</h4>
<p>
Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by
restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private
and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.
</p>

<h4 class="green under">Abstraction</h4>
<p>
Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any
particular instance. Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent
of the class rather than the actual implementation. In a way, one class
should not know the inner details of another in order to use it, just
knowing the interfaces should be good enough.
</p>

<h4 class="blue under">Inheritance</h4>
<p>
Inheritances expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two
objects. Using Inheritance, In derived classes we can reuse the code of
existing super classes. In Java, concept of “is-a” is based on class
inheritance (using extends) or interface implementation (using
implements). For example, FileInputStream "is-a" InputStream that reads
from a file.
</p>

<h4 class="blue under">Polymorphism</h4>
<p>
It means one name many forms. It is further of two types — static and
dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and
dynamic polymorphism using method overriding. It is closely related to
inheritance. We can write a code that works on the superclass, and it will
work with any subclass type as well.
